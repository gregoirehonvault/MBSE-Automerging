an n10 1 {une note}
an n0 1 {t0 - The user interacts with the system, triggering the transition to the 'U67Start' state where the system responds to user actions.}
an n3 1 {t3 - A sensor detects an input or a change in state, resulting in the transition to the 'Active' state where the system reacts based on the sensor information.}
an n2 1 {t2 - A countdown timer reaches zero, triggering the transition to the 'Active' state where the system enters a scheduled or periodic activity phase.}
an n4 1 {t4 - Received The system receives an external signal, such as communication from another system, putting it in the 'Active' state to process or respond to that signal.}
an n6 1 {nom_tr1 - The system emerges from a sleep or standby state and enters the 'Active' state, ready to resume normal operation.}
an n5 1 {t5 - Upon receiving a power signal, the system transitions to the 'Active' state, ready to respond to user interactions.}
