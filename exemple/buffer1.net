an n0 1 {t0 - Through user interaction, the system transitions into the 'U67Start' state, enabling it to effectively respond to the user's actions.}
an n3 1 {t3 - When a sensor detects an input or a change in state, it triggers the transition to the 'Active' state. In this state, the system reacts based on the information obtained from the sensor.}
an n2 1 {t2 - When a countdown timer reaches zero, it initiates the transition to the 'Active' state. In this state, the system enters a scheduled or periodic activity phase.}
an n4 1 {t4 - Upon receiving an external signal, such as communication from another system, the system enters the 'Active' state. In this state, it processes or responds to the received signal.}
an n6 1 {nom_tr1 - When the system emerges from a sleep or standby state, it transitions into the 'Active' state, becoming ready to resume normal operation.}
an n7 1 {taratata - When the system receives a power signal, it undergoes a transition to the 'Active' state, becoming prepared to respond to user interactions.}
